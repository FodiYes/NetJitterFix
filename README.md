  - Measure packet loss, jitter, latency, and bandwidth
  - Compare before/after optimization results
  - Visual performance graphs

- 🛠 **Advanced Optimization**
  - MTU size optimization
  - TCP/UDP parameters tuning
  - Network buffer management
  - Automatic best settings detection

- 💻 **Modern User Interface**
  - Clean and intuitive design
  - Real-time status updates
  - Easy-to-use toggle switches
  - Performance visualization

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Windows operating system
- Administrator privileges (for network settings modification)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/FodiYes/netjitterfix.git
cd netjitterfix
```

2. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r utils/requirements.txt
```

3. Run the application:
```bash
python main.py
```

## 🎯 Usage

1. Launch the application with administrator privileges
2. Run a pre-optimization test to measure current network performance
3. Enable desired optimizations using the toggle switches
4. Run a post-optimization test to see the improvements
5. Use the comparison graph to analyze the results

## 🔧 Optimization Details

### MTU Optimization
- Tests different MTU sizes to find the optimal value
- Reduces packet fragmentation
- Improves network efficiency

### TCP/UDP Optimization
- Adjusts TCP window size
- Optimizes acknowledgment frequency
- Tunes congestion control parameters

### Buffer Management
- Optimizes network buffer sizes
- Reduces bufferbloat
- Improves latency consistency
